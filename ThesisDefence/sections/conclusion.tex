    \DPmst\ proved to be a highly effective algorithm for computing and maintaining an \mst\ with substantial parallelization, surpassing other algorithms in both performance and scalability. This project validates the \dpm's potential for solving complex graph problems and highlights its broader applicability in parallel computing and provides critical optimizations for the framework itself.
    
    There are many open research directions to explore. For instance:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Extend the implementation to use several machines
        \item Broader experiments with algorithms for maintaining an \mst\ of dynamic graphs
        \item Explore other data structures inside the filter stage
        \item More precise analysis of cost
        \item ...
    \end{itemize}
