Currently, numerous applications rely on the concept of maintaining the connectivity of moving points or objects. One example is the use of networks consisting of cell phones or sensors that can communicate with each other. These networks involve establishing communication links between pairs of objects, each with its own associated cost. The minimum spanning tree of the dynamic graph is the set of connections that minimizes the cost of maintaining all the connected objects.

During this Master's thesis, we will explore a novel method for representing kinetic data sets in a more intuitive way. This method involves organising the graph along a Dynamic Pipeline, which allows for better distribution of the data. We will empirically determine the most suitable data structure and algorithms to implement the desired functionality. Moreover, we will conduct a comparative analysis with traditional algorithms for minimum spanning trees and algorithms for dynamic minimum spanning trees.
