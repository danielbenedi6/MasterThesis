# Dynamic Pipeline applied to Fully Dynamic Minimum Spanning Trees
This project lays under the scope of my master's thesis. 

A Minimum Spanning Tree is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted 
undirected graph that connects all the vertices together, without any cycles 
and with the minimum possible total edge weight. 

Dynamic Pipelining is a novel concurrent paradigm based on Divide and Conquer.
The key idea is to stablish dynamically a set of filters that will process the
input data and, when requested, it will return the desired property from the
input data.
